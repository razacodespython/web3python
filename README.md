# Python in web3

So I think that Python is a bit under respresented in the web3 space. Atleast that's what I've been noticing on twitter. That's why I'm building out this repo, for anyone who is interested in using Python in web3. These are just some of my scripts that I wrote and used. Feel free to use them!

## The structure

The way I structured this repo is by grouping the different libraries by folder. So web3.py is a folder and inside of it, im using scripts focused on web3.py.
There might also be a folder where multiple libraries are used. Generally speaking this probably goes for frameworks like Django or FastAPI.


## Current folders

1. Web3.Py
2. thirdweb
